Find the repeating and missing numbers
Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1,N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.

Example 1:

Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}

Result: {3,4)

Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4 
Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing
CODE:
int n=nums.size();
        int x1=0;int x2=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            x1=x1^nums[i]; // let say array is 3,0,1 then x1 will store  3^0^1 
            x2=x2^(i+1);     // here x2 will store 1^2^3
        }
        return x1^x2;
